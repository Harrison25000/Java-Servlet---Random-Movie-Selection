# Java-Servlet---Random-Movie-Selection
Using a Java Servlet to communicate, and route, with html pages. Also using the 'The Movie Database' API to receive a list of films/actors/ratings etc. in JSON.

Running on a TomCat Server locally. 

Potential to setup with Heroku however it is just a personal training exercise into Java Servlet's, TomCat and integrating Java with a front end HTML page.
